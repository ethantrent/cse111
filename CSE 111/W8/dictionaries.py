# DICTIONARIES

"""A Python program can store many items in a dictionary. Each item in a dictionary is a key value pair. 
Each key within a dictionary must be unique. In other words, no key can appear more than once in a dictionary. 
Values within a dictionary do not have to be unique"""

"""We can create a dictionary by using curly braces { and }. We can add an item to a dictionary and 
find an item in a dictionary by using square brackets [ and ] and a key."""

# Example 1

    # the keys and student names as the values.

# COMPOUND VALUES

"""A simple value is a value that doesn’t contain parts, such as an integer or a string. 
A compound value is a value that has parts, such as a list."""

# Example 2

# FINDING ONE ITEM
